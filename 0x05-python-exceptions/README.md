0x05. Python - Exceptions

Introduction
This directory provides an overview of exceptions and exception handling in Python. Exceptions are events that can disrupt the normal flow of a program's execution, often caused by errors or unexpected situations. Python's exception handling mechanism allows developers to gracefully handle such situations and write more robust code.

What are Exceptions?
In Python, exceptions are unexpected events that can occur during program execution and disrupt the normal flow of the program. They can be errors or exceptional situations that the programmer needs to account for. When an exception occurs, it generates an exception object that contains information about the error, including its type and a description.

Exception Handling
try...except
The try...except block is used to handle exceptions. The code within the try block is monitored for exceptions. If an exception occurs, the program jumps to the corresponding except block that can handle the specific exception type.
